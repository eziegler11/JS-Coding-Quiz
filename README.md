# Multiple Choice Coding Quiz - JavaScript

## Description

I was inspired to make this multiple choice coding quiz as an easy, fun, and interactive way to study key coding topics. I can update the questions as my learning continues, which would make for a fun project in the long term.
I learned a lot through this project. It's the largest JavaScript project that I have worked on, so putting it all together was challenging, but a very great learning experience. It was also enjoyable to have very minimal HTML within my Index file and then using JavaScript to manipulate everything that the user sees on the app.

## Installation

Fork my code through GitHub and you can get started just by using the HTML, CSS files and the JavaScript file.

## Usage
